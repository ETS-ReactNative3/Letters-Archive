## Overview

For my Mobile Application Development class, I created a mobile app in React Native inspired by [The Unsent Projects](https://theunsentproject.com). Letters Archive provides a safe space for users to talk about their feelings anonymously.

### Features

Users should be able to:

- Login/Sign Up for an account
- Create and post letters

### Further Development

I want to add a search input that will sort the posts by a specific name. I also want to sort the letters displayed on the Home page from most recent to oldest posts.
